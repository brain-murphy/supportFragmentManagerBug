# Support Fragment Manager Bug
This is a repository that demos a bug in the Android supportFragmentManager.

This example is based off the Android Fragments tutorial https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html

To reproduce the bug, open the app in an API level 23 emulator, and click on one of the list items.
Then, rotate the screen. When you click the a list item with the screen rotated, the app should crash.
